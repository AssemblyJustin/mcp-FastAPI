## âœ… Expected AI Response

After using this prompt, expect:

```
âœ… CONTINUATION CONTEXT LOADED - Ready to continue previous work. I understand the current state and previous session outcomes.

I have successfully loaded and understand:
- Current project state from [specific summary loaded]
- Previous session outcomes: [specific outcomes from the summary]
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Next steps identified in the previous session
- Current blockers or considerations: [any issues noted]
- Relevant validation commands for continuing the work

Based on the previous session, I understand we were working on [specific previous work] and the next steps are [specific next steps]. I'm ready to continue where we left off.

Would you like me to [suggest specific continuation actions based on previous session]?
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### **1. Always Reference Recent Work**
- Use the most recent relevant chat summary
- Include specific context files from previous work type
- Mention any blockers or decisions from previous session

### **2. Be Specific About Continuation**
```
TASK: Continue working on [specific item] - [specific next step]
```

### **3. Validate Previous Work**
Ask the AI to confirm understanding of:
- What was completed in the previous session
- What decisions were made and why
- What the next steps should be

### **4. Update Context as Needed**
If the previous session created new files or changed structure:
```
4. [new-file-created-in-previous-session].md (new context from previous work)
```
