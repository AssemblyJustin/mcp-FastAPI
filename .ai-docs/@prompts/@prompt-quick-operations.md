- Directory organization rules and forbidden locations
- 1:1:1 relationship requirement (code-example â†” blueprint â†” test)
- Basic project structure (frontend-mcp/, tests/, scripts/, docs/)
- Validation command: python scripts/validate_ai_context.py --check-all

CONFIRMATION PROMPT:
Please respond with: "âœ… CONTEXT LOADED - Ready for file operations. I understand naming conventions and directory rules."

TASK: [Describe your quick task here]
```

- Configuration file formats
- Git and version control considerations
```

## âœ… Expected AI Response

After using this prompt, expect:

```
âœ… CONTEXT LOADED - Ready for file operations. I understand naming conventions and directory rules.

I have successfully loaded and understand:
- File naming conventions: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for blueprints, snake_case for tests
- Directory organization with frontend-mcp/, tests/, scripts/, docs/ structure
- Forbidden locations (no components at root, no tests outside tests/)
- 1:1:1 relationship requirement for components
- Basic project structure and file authority hierarchy
- Validation using python scripts/validate_ai_context.py --check-all

I'm ready to help with your quick task. What specific file operation or simple task would you like me to assist with?
